## Real-time Light Curve Classification Framework for the Wide Field Survey Telescope Using Modified Semi-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder

This GitHub repository contains the main code used for building and training the light curve classifier for the WFST. The method corresponds to the paper titled "Real-time Light Curve Classification Framework for the Wide Field Survey Telescope Using a Modified Semi-supervised Variational Autoencoder".

> As of 2025-03, the current files in this repository are somewhat disorganized. Issues include:
> - Annotations are still written in Chinese.
> - Some parameters are not well named, which could cause confusion when someone tries to adjust them.
> - Certain paths need to be updated to run the code successfully.
>
> The .py file is complete and ready for use if you want to run this model on your own data. Just remember to prepare your data in the correct format. We will continuously update this repository to make it more user-friendly.
